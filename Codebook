SamsungGalaxyS Project
Getting and Cleaning Data-Tidy Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked below represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The script should do the following:  
Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
