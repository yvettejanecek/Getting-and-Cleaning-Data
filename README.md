Run script run_analysis.R

This script does the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names for each activity in the data set

Appropriately lables the data set with descriptive variable names

Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subect.

  This resultant data set is TidyRunAnalysis.txt
